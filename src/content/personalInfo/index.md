Hi, I'm Haripriya!
<br><br>

I am currently completing my PhD in pure mathematics, a journey that has led me to develop a novel connection between the fields of complex geometry and K-theory.
<br><br>

In my thesis, supervised by Professors <a href="http://www.maths.adelaide.edu.au/finnur.larusson/" >Finnur LÃ¡russon</a> and <a href="https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/christian-haesemeyer/">Christian Haesemeyer</a>, and Associate Professor <a href="https://www.dcrowley.net/">Diarmuid Crowley</a>, I reveal an Oka principle within the realm of higher, twisted K-theory. Traditionally, the Oka principle is a fundamental pattern that repeatedly occurs in complex geometry, wherein certain holomorphic problems (problems that fit seamlessly in the realm of complex numbers) only have topological (shape-based) obstructions. Extending this principle to the setting of higher, twisted K-theory, involves introducing the brand new construction of "holomorphic, higher twisted K-theory", then proving the Oka principle with respect to this new structure.
<br><br>

For those unfamiliar, K-theory provides a vast toolkit for dissecting and understanding higher-dimensional intricacies of spaces and algebraic structures. It has profound applications in various domains, including areas of physics such as string theory. By introducing Oka principle into this framework, my research diversifies the ways in which these existing - and new - mathematical structures can be manipulated and understood.
<br><br>

This work represents a harmonious convergence of foundational theories and introduces a new conceptual toolkit that will hopefully inspire and underpin many years of mathematical inquiry. My goal is to make these complex ideas accessible and engaging not just to fellow mathematicians but also to a broader academic audience interested in the evolution of mathematical thought.
